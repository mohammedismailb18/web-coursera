        <h2>Using Web Coursera</h2>
        <h3>Who May Use our Services</h3>
        <p>You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with Coursera, and only in 
           compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. When you create your Coursera account, 
           and subsequently when you use certain features, you must provide us with accurate and complete
           information, and you agree to update your information to keep it accurate and complete. Any use

           may have additional requirements and/or restrictions.
        </p>
        <h3>Our License to You</h3>
        <p>Subject to these Terms and our policies (including the Acceptable Use Policy, Honor Code, 
           course-specific eligibility requirements, and other terms), we grant you a limited, personal,
           non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Services. You may download
           content from our Services only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you obtain our
           written permission to otherwise use the content. You also agree that you will create, access,
           and/or use only one user account, unless expressly permitted by Web Coursera, and you will not
           share access to your account or access information for your account with any third party. Using 
           our Services does not give you ownership of or any intellectual property rights in our Services
           or the content you access.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Your Content</h2>

This license includes granting Web Coursera the right to authorize Content Providers to use User Content with their registered students, on-campus learners, or other learners independent of the Services. Nothing in these Terms shall restrict other legal rights Web Coursera may have to User Content, for example under other licenses. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or other policies including our Acceptable Use Policy and Code of Conduct.</p>
